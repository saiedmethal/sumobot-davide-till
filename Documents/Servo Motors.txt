The increment of the servomotor is 2 micro-seconds every step. So, in the initialization we have to calculate that the value of the servor's speed has to be moltiplied by 2.
The right motor movement always has to be decreased if the left motor movement is increased and they should go into the same direction.

Example:
Move Forward servo = 1000		// real speed 2000 microseconds

Stop servo = 750		// real speed 1500 microseconds (at this value the servo is 
Move Backward servo = 500			   stopped 

									_      _
- 1500, 2000, etc, is the time of high time during the pulse width. ___| |____| |___

Graph:

500 (very fast - backward) ---- 600 (fast - backward) ---- 700 (slow - backward) ---- 750 (stop) ----- 800 (slow - forward) ----- 900 (fast - forward) ----- 1000 (very fast - forward)
